    <h2>Why Classical Hatha Yoga?</h2>
<p>Yoga is a profound technology for exploring one's inner nature. It opens up the possibility of experiencing life at a deeper level, which most of us would otherwise miss. But today, in many parts of the world, Yoga is practiced as a group event. While it might give some solace and relaxation from stressful life and physical relief from desk jobs, it fails to serve its original purpose. </p>
<p>We offer Classical Hatha Yoga, which has survived many millennia simply due to its efficacy, in its original form without any modifications. Sadhguru's insights and guidance ensure the transmission of this technology as a tool for inner exploration. They are designed to create an inner balance, raise your energies, and bring clarity in life. Since my journey started in 2021, Yoga has made my life a love affair.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en">Every particle in your body is communicating with the entire cosmos. Yoga is about experiencing that. <br>&mdash;&nbsp<span>Sadhguru</span>
