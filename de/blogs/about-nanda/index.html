      <h2>A little background</h2>
      <p>
      When it was time for me to decide on a career path as a student from India, I felt like there were only two options; Engineering or medicine. Somehow I liked neither the smell of the hospitals nor the bitterness of the pills. So the choice was clear.
      <br><br>
    
      I was curious, about how everything works, particularly, the human mechanism. However, I chose electrical engineering to study because I thought it would be a harder subject for me to explore myself and an easier area to get practical experience in the real world at that time.
      I did my engineering and continued with my master's and doctoral studies. Finally started working in a research lab of a multinational company and was working with highly skilled people. I felt it suited me, as I was always busy with studies myself.
      <br><br>
      By this time, the journey has taken me from India to the US and then to Europe. I have admired their precision manufacturing, high-quality infrastructure, and rule-abiding citizens. However, the intensity in life was missing, and beautiful things in life were missing. Working ethos seems to be for evening drinks and weekend shopping. I have started missing India.
      </p>
      <h2>Meets Sadhguru and the time in the Ashram</h2>
      <p>Then I met Sadhguru online and my long-held back quest to know life a little deeper spiked. I realized that the possibility exists.
      In 2021, I took up a 21-week long, full-time, 1750+ hour intense Hatha Yoga teacher training at Sadhguru's Ashram, Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, India. It was a period of conscious evolution for my body, mind, and energy. It was life-transforming on many levels.
      <br><br>
      About PhD Sadhguru once joked that it is Permanent head Damage. Maybe, he is right :) I learned more about life (or better to say experienced) during my training at Isha yoga center than during my entire education.
      But if I had not walked that way, I would not be here today.
    </p>
      <h2>Why teaching</h2>
      <p>I also have a quest for knowledge. But how many books will you read? Reading transfer information one word at a time. A very inefficient way of knowing. They are indeed useful. Some inspirational, some instructive. It can help you acquire skills, provide service and earn income. However, their ability to enhance your experience of life is quite limited. Without an enhanced experience of life, the services we provide in this life often could be misdirected.
      <br><br>
      The short time I spent in the Ashram under the guidance of Sadhguru changed the way I breathe, the way I experience food, the way I experience sound, the people and everything around me, and the way I respond to situations in life. Certain clarity of mind has come and a certain direction of growth has been set for life. I have broken away from, what would normally look like a promising career path for this. But without this, whatever I would have gained from the other path would have not been of any significant use to me.
      <br><br> 
      Seeking about the nature of life, not just reading about it in a book, is a quality that we need around the world. We may take separate identities such as doctors, engineers, teachers, salesman, farmers, caretakers, office workers and many more. But we all live a life, and seeking by turning inwards, looking at ourselves, is the only way for us to grow in life. Most of us have moments of growth in life, especially when we go through challenging times. This is an accidental growth and we wish for such times to never come again.
      Yoga offers tools for the conscious evolution of yourself for every moment of your life.
      <br><br> 
      What is the use of this growth? I cannot sell it in the market. Well, now life has become a possibility. A possibility that something beautiful might come through this.
      <br><br> 
      Since I got a glimpse of the science of yoga, I consider it a great privilege to be a channel for the transmission of these tools of transformation. 
      <br><br> 
      The world is facing many multi-faceted challenges. No single person or government can solve this alone. Our best bet is to raise our consciousness. Each one of us strives to enhance our experience of life. Once, our experience of life is enhanced, the little problems each one of us faces, we will solve them in a way that suits the life at large. When we stop becoming the hurdle in our lives, life will start to show its beauty.

      <p>
      Yoga in India gave rise to a civilization steeped in devotion, art, music, dance, celebration, and feminine worship. It gave Ayurveda to the world. The temples it created were not places of worship but rather places for uplifting human beings. As a land, once it stood tall in the world arena and was the most sought-after. However, the invention of gunpowder happened elsewhere and it failed to protect itself. Now it has seen a series of external invasions, that systematically tried to break its culture. False narratives, primarily out of ignorance, were fed and are being fed about it within and around the world. The tragedy is that even its citizens are ignorant of its value and mistrust it.
    </p><hr><br>
      <h2>A few inspirations</h2>
      <p>
      Once I heard a Vedic math prose. It was a combination of scientific knowledge, mathematical precision, poetry, linguistics, and devotion in a very beautiful way. I knew whoever created it was incredible.

          <p>I would like to show you some more works from India in the past. When I look at them it is the devotion 
            of the people of that time that I am wondering about. </p>
