  <h2>Nanda</h2>
   
<p>Namaskaram! I'm Nanda, originally from Kerala, India. I have a PhD in Electrical Engineering. I have worked for a short while on hardware for artificial intelligence. Somehow, I felt my education was incomplete.  Even though it taught me many things about the outside world, about me, the centerpiece in my life, I have not learned enough. What does it mean to be a human being? Though I was successful in the outside world, within myself, I was confused. How should I be? </p>

<p>Then one day I saw a video of a man in shiny dress with turban and grey beard talking with Neuroscientists from US universities (<a href="https://youtu.be/MwgkvBZXum0?si=u4dF8vuu_iBbRUG6">video</a>). I was astounded with the wit and wisdom with which he was speaking. I was simply joyful that such a man exists. I realized there is a entirely different way to exist for a human being. That was Sadhguru. </p>
<p>I was sold. I decided to do the longest program that he was offering. I was not sure if I am a quick learner in this new domain. I finally did my Hatha Yoga Teacher training in 2021. As a pre-requisite I have done Inner Engineering and Surya Kriya. In the succeeding years, I did remaining Kriya Yoga programs he offered. Each program entirely shifted my perspective and experience of life. </p>
<p>To be honest, it is not an easy journey. The physical part was easy. I went through the training, did the practices, the physical benefits were incredible. I became healthy and agile in the body, sharp and light in the mind. But being physically and mentally well are just good basics. To realize the possibility of being aware was on a completely different dimension. This is something I have never done or imagined possible. </p>

<p>Now, everyday for me life is on an exploratory mode. What excites me more is an imagination of the world filled with people who are more aware. This statement is not a marketing gimmick from me as a hatha yoga teacher. As an engineer I was interested in solving problems. But it seems like every year we are creating more problems than the ones we are solving. If Yoga can help people become more aware, many of these problems will simply disappear. So I realized, instead of solving problems, eliminating them is a much more efficient approach. This would naturally happen as people become more aware.</p>

By the way, Namaskaram is a way of greeting originating from the Yogic tradition. It is a reminder that the signature of the creation is there in every being.
