<p> As a child, I was a play-hard, fighting boy and average in school. Maybe my primary school friends will know it. My teachers at that time used to punish me and complain to my parents. But my later friends may know me as a studious or silent kid. Something significantly changed within me in between. </p>

<p>  I recently realized that yoga is not something I started recently but has been influencing and inspiring me since childhood. </p>
  
<p>  I was 8 or 9 years old. My parents made me do a 9-day ritual in a local temple. I was staying full-time in the temple. I liked it. Around this time, my mom and dad lovingly initiated me to chant certain mantras. I also picked up some rudimentary yogic practices from somewhere. As a young child, I took them all sincerely to my heart and made them part of my everyday ritual without anyone noticing. This gave me a certain balance and an ability to stay focused. Suddenly, I changed from an average to a very good student, and the balance and focus helped me overcome many challenges throughout my education.</p>
  
<p> At that time, maybe I did not fully appreciate the value of these simple spiritual practices I had been doing. But as a child, I did them with my whole heart, trust, and sincerity. </p>

<p> As I went through conventional education, I started to look down on my practices and lost my sincerity. Slowly, I dropped them, and their impact waned, and I began to lose focus, direction, and energy.  </p>

<p> Then Sadhguru happened. He made absolute sense to me. My Sadhana has started. However, by this time, my mind had taken some direction and prevented me from giving my one hundred per cent. </p>

<p> Due to my lack of sincerity, what could have happened in a moment took many months. What could have happened in a few months took a few years. But I am adamant and committed. </p>

<p> Our commitment to the continuous evolution of our being is all that is needed. A little more sincerity will hasten the process, though this may not always be in our hands. But if we are committed, everything will fall into place in time.</p>
