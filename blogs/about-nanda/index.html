<h2>A short answer</h2>
<p> This life and human mechanism is what fascinates me most. Even after earning a PhD in Electrical Engineering, and working in the US, Europe, and India, Yoga is the most sophisticated technology I encountered that can have the most positive impact at a fundamental level on a human being. It seems only natural for me to explore it to the extent possible and to share it with a maximum number of people. </p>

  <h2>A little background</h2>
  <p>
  When it was time for me to decide on a career path as a student from India, I felt like there were only two options; Engineering or medicine. Somehow I liked neither the smell of the hospitals nor the bitterness of the pills. So the choice was clear.
  <br><br>

  I was always curious about one thing, the human mechanism. 'Why are the people the way they are? Why am I the way I am? What is this life about?'. I was also curious about the impact of the outside world and technology on us. I chose electrical engineering to study because I thought it would be the hardest technology for me to understand myself.
I did my engineering and continued with my master's and doctoral studies. Finally started working in a research lab of a multinational company and was working with highly skilled people. I thought it suited me.
  <br><br>
  By this time, the journey has taken me from India to the US and then to Europe. I have admired their precision manufacturing, high-quality infrastructure, and rule-abiding citizens. However, the intensity in life was missing, and beautiful things in life were missing. Working ethos seems to be for evening drinks and weekend shopping. I have started missing India.
  </p>
  <h2>Meeting Sadhguru and the time in the Ashram</h2>
  <p>Then I met Sadhguru online and my long-held back quest to know life a little deeper spiked. I realized that the possibility exists.
    In 2021, I took up a 21-week long, full-time, 1750+ hour intense Hatha Yoga teacher training at Sadhguru's Ashram, Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore, India. It was a period of intense Sadhana. It was the first time for me to be in the Ashram. I was not sure what was supposed to happen. I was simply there and willing to do whatever I was asked to do. It took some time but slowly I started to notice the changes. My body has become light in my experience. The breath has deepened and has become so smooth like silk. The way I experience food has significantly changed.  The way I experience sound, people, and everything around me has changed. A need to react to situations has come down. My mind has become quieter than usual. It become so much easier to be simply joyful and smile. My energy level has increased and I was more willing to do whatever was required. 
    Above all, I could feel certain stability and stillness within me. This was priceless.

<p>Sadhguru has said, "Hatha Yoga is about creating a body that will not be a hurdle but a stepping stone for you to blossom into your ultimate possibility." </p>

  About PhD Sadhguru once joked that it is Permanent head Damage. Maybe, he is right :) During my training, I think I wasted a lot of time trying to reach conclusions about what was supposed to happen when I had barely started on the path. Still, I learned more about life (or better to say experienced life) during my training at Isha yoga center than during my entire education.
But if I had not walked that way, I would not be here today.

<br><br>
Here are some glimpses from the teacher training program at Ashram. </p>

  <h2>Why become a teacher?</h2>
  <p>I also have a quest for knowledge. But how many books will you read? Reading transfer information one word at a time. A very inefficient way of knowing. They are indeed useful. Some inspirational, some instructive. It can help you to acquire skills, to provide services and to earn an income. However, their ability to enhance your experience of life is quite limited. Without an enhanced experience of life, the services we provide in this life could often be misdirected.
  <br><br>
  The short time I spent in the Ashram under the guidance of Sadhguru was a period of conscious evolution for my body, mind, and energy. It was life-transforming on many levels. Certain clarity of mind has come and a certain direction of growth has been set for life. I have broken away from, what would normally look like a promising career path for this. But without the fundamentals provided by yoga, without the tools for constant growth within, whatever I would have gained from the other path would not have been of any significance to me.
  <br><br> 
  Seeking about the nature of life, not just reading about it in a book, is a quality that we need around the world. We may take separate identities such as doctors, engineers, teachers, salesman, farmers, caretakers, office workers and many more. But we all live a life. Turning inward and being able to use our body, mind, emotions, and energies to their full potential is the only way to live a sensible life.  Most of us have moments of growth in life, especially when we go through challenging times. This is an accidental growth and we wish for such times to never come again. Yoga offers tools for the conscious evolution of yourself for every moment of your life.
  Now life becomes a possibility. A possibility that something beautiful might come through this.
  <br><br> 
  Since I got a glimpse of the science of yoga, I consider it a great privilege to be a channel for the transmission of these tools of transformation. 
  <br><br> 
  The world is facing many multi-faceted challenges. No single person or government can solve this alone. Our best bet is to raise our consciousness. Each one of us strives to enhance our experience of life. Once, our experience of life is enhanced, the problems each one of us faces, we will solve them in a way that suits the life at large. When we stop becoming the hurdle in our lives, life will start to show its beauty.

  <p>
  Yoga in India gave rise to a civilization steeped in devotion, art, music, dance, celebration, and feminine worship. It gave Ayurveda to the world. The temples it created were not places of worship but rather places for uplifting human beings. As a land, once it stood tall in the world arena and was the most sought-after. However, the invention of gunpowder happened elsewhere and it failed to protect itself. Now it has seen a series of external invasions, that systematically tried to break its culture. False narratives, primarily out of ignorance, were fed and are being fed about it within and around the world. The tragedy is that even its citizens are ignorant of its value and mistrust it.

  <h2>A few inspirations</h2>
  <p>
  Once I heard a Vedic math prose. It was a combination of scientific knowledge, mathematical precision, poetry, linguistics, and devotion in a very beautiful way. I knew whoever created it was incredible.

    <i>(Sanskrit)</i>
    <p>gopi bhagya madhuvrata srngiso dadhi sandhiga | <br>
        khala jivita khatava gala hala rasandara || </p>
    <i>(English)</i>
      <p>  Oh Krishna, the fortune of the Gopis,<br>
        The distroyer of the demon Madhu,<br>
        The protector of cattle,<br>
        The one who ventured the ocean depths,<br>
        destroyer of evildoers,<br>
        one with plough on the shoulder,<br>
        and the bearer of nectar, may (you) protect (us) <p>

      <p>  The original Sanskrit prose encode the value Pi upto 31 decimal places. <br> Check this

      <br>
      <p>I would like to show you some more works from India in the past. When I look at them it is the devotion 
        of the people of that time that I am wondering about. </p>
