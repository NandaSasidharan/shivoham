  <h3>How did I become a Hatha Yoga teacher?</h3>
  <p>I was a playful, fighting and at occations shy as a child. Weaker financial situation at
    home and a reading habit I
    picked up (thanks to my dad, and a next-door library) when I was around 9, helped me become studious. I received
    a PhD in Electrical engineering from a US university and worked as a research fellow
    at a European research lab. But as a scientist, one's first most quest is
    to understand what life is. </p>
  <br>

    <p>About PhD Sadhguru once joked that it is Permanent head Damage. Maybe, he is right :)
    I learned (or experienced) more about life during my training at Isha yoga
    center than during my entire education. <br>
    But if I have not walked that way, I would not be here today. </p>



  <p>  Once I heard a Vedic math prose. It was a combination of scientific
    knowledge, mathematical precision, poetry, linguistics, and devotion in
    a very beautiful way. I knew whoever created it was incredible. </p>
  <br>

    <i>(Sanskrit)</i>
    <p>gopi bhagya madhuvrata srngiso dadhi sandhiga | <br>
        khala jivita khatava gala hala rasandara || </p>
    <i>(English)</i>
      <p>  Oh Krishna, the fortune of the Gopis,<br>
        The distroyer of the demon Madhu,<br>
        The protector of cattle,<br>
        The one who ventured the ocean depths,<br>
        destroyer of evildoers,<br>
        one with plough on the shoulder,<br>
        and the bearer of nectar, may (you) protect (us) <p>

      <p>  The original Sanskrit prose encode the value Pi upto 31 decimal places. <br>
      <a href="https://youtu.be/y7ELIegItxY?t=707" target="_blank">[How?]</a>  </p>


  <p>  I met Sadhguru online. For the first time someone seemed to make total
    sense. The absolute clarity he demonstrated was first of its kind for me.
    I simply cannot avoid an opportunity to learn from him. But I did not trust
    me to be a quick and committed learner in this new domain. So I took a
    break from my research job, and took up intense Hatha yoga teacher training
    at Isha yoga center, Coimbatore, India lasting 21 weeks.</p>

  <br>
  <p>It is where I understood the difference between experiencing life and
    reading about it in a book. It is where I experienced the different
    dimensions of mind. It is where I understood what it meant to be loving.
    It is where I understood what it meant to be living. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Today I am here sharing what he offers while I walk my way.
