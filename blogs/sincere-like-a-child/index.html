  <p>Sadhguru has often mentioned that when he was young, he did some simple asanas, but it was the way he did them that made the difference. </p>

  <p>When we first learned the various tools Sadhguru has offered us, either Hatha Yoga or Isha Yoga programs from the Ashram, we gave ourselves fully and saw a glimpse of what it could do for us. </p>
  
  <p>But are you in a state where since you started practising at home not sure if you are progressing?</p>
  
  <p>These tools are designed to create an inner balance and to enhance our perception. If we do our Sadhana regularly we are definitely making steps in the right direction. But how large a stride we make may depend on our sincerity during our Sadhana.  </p>
  
  <p>Our lack of sincerity may not be completely our fault. Many factors could contribute, including our social upbringing.  </p>
  
  <p>Here I would like to share something from my experience.</p>
  
  <p>As a child, I was a play-hard, fighting boy and average in school. Maybe my primary school friends will know it. I used to get punished and the teachers complained to my parents. But my later friends may know me as a studious or silent kid. Something significantly changed within me in between. </p>
  
  <p>I recently realized that yoga is not something I started recently but some aspects of it have been influencing and inspiring me since childhood. </p>
  
  <p>I was 8 or 9 years old. My parents made me do a 9-day ritual in a local temple. I was staying full-time in the temple. I enjoyed it. Around this time, my mom and dad lovingly initiated me to chant certain mantras. I also picked up some rudimentary yogic practices from somewhere. As a young child growing up with stories from Indian Puranas, I took them all sincerely to my heart and made them part of my everyday ritual without anyone noticing. This gave me a certain balance and ability to stay focused. In a short period, I became a top student, and they helped me overcome many challenges throughout my education.</p>
  
  <p>At that time, maybe I did not fully appreciate the value of these simple spiritual practices I had been doing. But as a child, I did them with my whole heart, trust, and sincerity. </p>
  
  <p>As I went through conventional education, my sincerity towards the practices went down. Slowly, I dropped them, and their impact waned, and I began to lose focus, direction, and energy.  </p>
  
  <p>One of these days I happen to see a talk from Sadhguru online. Like many others, I simply sat there listening with a wholehearted smile. He made absolute sense to me. I realized that I have to receive whatever he is offering. My Sadhana has started. However, by this time, my body and mind had taken some directions and attitudes which prevented me from giving my one hundred per cent. Maybe I forgot how to be fully involved anymore like a child.</p>
  
  <p>Somewhere my sincerity was not full on like a child, and as a result, what could have happened in a moment took many months. What could have happened in a few months took a few years. But I have realized their significance in my life. Therefore, I could not look back and kept moving forward. </p>
  
  <p>Our commitment to the continuous evolution of our being is all that is needed. A little more sincerity will hasten the process, though this may not always be in our hands. But from my experience, as I stay committed things seem to fall in place on time. </p>
  
  <p>Even if you have learned some practices out of curiosity, give yourself sincerely to the process. They can change the way you experience life. </p>
