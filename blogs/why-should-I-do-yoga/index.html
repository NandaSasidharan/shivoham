    <h2>First step</h2>
    <p>is to decide how you want to be.</p>
    <h2>What concerns you today?</h2>
    <p>Health | Peace | Success | Joy</p>

    <h3>Health, Peace, Success, Joy </h3>
    <p>Being healthy, peaceful, successful, and joyful essentially depends on how well we are able to handle our body, mind, emotions and energy. </p>
    <p>"The human mechanism is the most sophisticated machinery on this planet. But have you read its user manual? If not, how do you expect to live well?" Asks Sadhguru.</p>
    <p>You may have read many tips and tricks to be healthy and successful. But have they truly worked for you? Maybe in a limited way!</p>
    <p>We do not offer yoga as a philosophy or theory, but rather a set of tools which can activate and balance the system, so that a natural blossoming happens from within. So that you are more energetic and emotionally balanced, and your ability to use your body and mind is enhanced. So that your ability to perceive life is enhanced. </p>
    
    <h3>The word yoga means union</h3>
    <p>Life exists only in this union. My five sense organs, my tools for survival, give me a sense of separation from the rest of the creation. But without this soil, water, air, and light do I have an existence?</p>
    <p>What separates me from you are the different levels of memory that we carry - the genetic memory, the food we ate, the stories we heard, and the social situations that we went through. These memories are commonly summed up as "Karma". Yoga offers tools and methods to wear down these Karmic memories and look at life at its core and build your life the way you want.</p>
    
    <h3>To perceive life</h3>
    <p>The only way to know something, let us say life, is to look at it with absolute attention, without an iota of judgement or preconceived notions. All yogic sadhana is towards enhancing your ability to perceive life.</p>
    <p>As you become more perceptive, you will gradually become aware of the nature of your body, mind, emotions and energy. Then being healthy and peaceful will just be side effects, and being joyful will be natural.</p>
