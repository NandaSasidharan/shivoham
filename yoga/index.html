    <p> Yoga is about determining the nature of who you are. Our means of knowing and experiencing life are our body, mind, emotions, and energies. Yoga offers tools to enhance our ability to perceive through these four pathways. You may approach Yoga through any one of them. Sadhguru says it is best to address all four of them in a balanced way.

    <h3>Bringing precision into life</h3>
    
    <p>"We have to work on clarity. What is it that gives us clarity of mind? A simple thing you can do to improve clarity is to handle everything you do with a certain precision. Hatha Yoga is all about precision - how your feet should be positioned, where your hands should be, how you should hold your head, how you move, how you place the things that you brought with you and so on. If you bring precision into your activity, there will be precision in your mind. You need to practice precision in every aspect of your life. How your room should be, how you go to bed - everything. Bring the meticulousness that you apply when doing an asana, into your life. You will see, slowly, the mind will become very clear. It will become meticulous with everything."</p>
    <p>- Sadhguru</p>

    <h3>Union of the four paths</h3>
    <div class="bgW2" style="margin:20px 0px"> <img src="/images/4paths-min.svg" alt="" width="90%"></div>
    <p>If you use your emotions and try to reach the ultimate, we call this  <b>bhakti&nbsp;yoga</b>.</p>
    <p>If you use your intelligence and try to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>gnana&nbsp;yoga</b>.</p>
    <p>If you use your body, or physical action to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>karma&nbsp;yoga</b>.</p>
    <p>If you transform your energies and try to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>kriya&nbsp;yoga</b>.</p>
    <p>These are the only four realities in your life: body, mind, emotion, and energy.
Whatever you wish to do with yourself, it must be on these four levels.
It is important that in a very balanced way all of them are addressed at once,
as&nbsp;one&nbsp;unit.</p>
<p>- Sadhguru</p>

    <h2>Right conditions for Sadhana (Yogic practices)</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Closed Eyes</h3>
        <p>For a human being, the visual apparatus are the most dominant. When you close your eyes, the world disappears - unless you have your own false world in your head! The eyes will naturally close for any internalization because the visual apparatus engage us with the outward. If you just close them, you can still hear, smell and feel, but half the world is shut off. So internalization happens best when your eyes are closed. When you're doing asanas, you want to internalize everything.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Empty Stomach</h3>
        <p>While practising yogasanas, you should not only be on an empty stomach, your bowels should be empty. Anything that is not the body should be out of the body if you want to move your energies upward. Yogic practices are not exercises, they are a way of restructuring your body and recreating yourself the way you want to be. If such a thing has to be done, nothing should be there other than your body.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Cold Water</h3>
        <p>Before beginning your practice, it is always best to be immersed in or to allow a certain volume of water which is about five to eight degree centigrade lower than room temperature to flow over you. If this happens, the pores between the skin cells open up, and that's important for practicing yoga because we want the cellular structure of the body to be charged with a different dimension of energy. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Frequency of Practice</h3>
        <p>The Yoga Sutra says - sukham sthiram asanam. The goal is to achieve a state where your asana is comfortable and stable; if you remain like this for any number of hours it stays the same way without causing any disturbance internally. This is when your perception becomes bigger and bigger.
The point is not about doing yoga every day or twice a week, the intention is to knead the body in such a way that we can re-mold it. So, how much time do you have, to do the necessary work upon yourself - that much time you must do it.
</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Using Mirrors/Listening to Music</h3>
        <p>There should never be a mirror or music when you practice Hata Yoga. <br>
        If you want to get the involvement of that which is the source of creation within you, your body, mind, and energy must be absolutely involved. If you look at a mirror, will you look at just yourself? Let's be straight about this. You will look at everyone else, isn't it? And your mental focus is most important while practicing asanas.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-33p box bgW2">
        <h3>Speaking</h3>
        <p>An asana is a dynamic way of meditating. Because you can't sit still, you're doing something else to become meditative. <br>
        If you speak, so many things change dramatically, not just physiologically but in the energy parameters also. So, not talking during the asana is not just a norm, it is a rule. </p>
