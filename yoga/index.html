        <p>The logic is for the mind. When the processes being offered is about going beyond the mind, trying to understand them logically will only unnecessarily delay the process. Instead, if you do them with full involvement and dedication, you will see that they begin to alter the way you see, feel, and perceive life. </p>

    <h3>How to do it right?</h3>
    <blockquote cite="https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en">Even if you practice Yoga for all the wrong reasons, if you do it right, it still works. <br>&mdash;&nbsp<span>Sadhguru</span></blockquote>
    
    <h4>Set the right conditions</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Dedicated space</li> <p>It is best if you have a  space at home dedicated for your yogic practices. Lighting an oil lamp will also be supportive.</p>
  <li>Empty Stomach and bowels</li> <p>Yoga is not just an exercise but a way of enhancing the human energy system. As Sadhguru explains, "Anything that is not the body should be out of the body if you want to move your energies upward." So make sure to do your yoga practice before you eat (ideally in the morning before breakfast) and after emptying the bowels. And in the same vein, there should be no intake of food or water while you do the yoga practice itself.</p>
  <li>Cold Water Shower</li> <p>Before beginning your practice, it is always best to be immersed in or to allow a certain volume of water which is about five to eight degree centigrade lower than room temperature to flow over you. If this happens, the pores between the skin cells open up, and that's important for practicing yoga because we want the cellular structure of the body to be charged with a different dimension of energy.</p>
  <li>Loose-fitting, comfortable clothes</li> <p>Yoga works on one's energy system. Wearing loose-fitting clothes assists in this process. Sadhguru says, "When your energies begin to expand within you, you will notice tight-fitting clothes will not be comfortable on your body. Naturally you would want a very loose fitting cloth."</p>
 <li>Consume neem and turmeric before the yoga practice</li> <p> Sadhguru says, "The consumption of neem and turmeric with tepid, light honey water is a wonderful way of cleansing and dilating the cellular structure in such a way that it is able to absorb energy. When you do sadhana, the dilation brings flexibility to the muscles. The flexibility helps you to slowly build the system into a more powerful possibility." </p>
  <li>Using Mirrors/Listening to Music</li> <p>There should never be a mirror or music when you practice Hata Yoga.
    If you want to get the involvement of that which is the source of creation within you, your body, mind, and energy must be absolutely involved. If you look at a mirror, will you look at just yourself? Let's be straight about this. You will look at everyone else, isn't it? And your mental focus is most important while practicing asanas.</p>
  <li>Speaking</li> <p>An asana is a dynamic way of meditating. Because you can't sit still, you're doing something else to become meditative.
    If you speak, so many things change dramatically, not just physiologically but in the energy parameters also. So, not talking during the asana is not just a norm, it is a rule.</p>
    <li>Closed Eyes</li>
    <p>For a human being, the visual apparatus are the most dominant. When you close your eyes, the world disappears - unless you have your own false world in your head! The eyes will naturally close for any internalization because the visual apparatus engage us with the outward. If you just close them, you can still hear, smell and feel, but half the world is shut off. So internalization happens best when your eyes are closed. When you're doing asanas, you want to internalize everything.
    </p>

<h3>Step one, balance!</h3>
<blockquote cite="https://isha.sadhguru.org/in/en">Sadhana is always structured like this: First, you establish Balance, then Intensity. Intensity without Balance can lead you completely off course. <br>&mdash;&nbsp<span>Sadhguru</span></blockquote>
<div class="youtube-player" data-id="wD-RH1fXjEs" style="width: 85%;"></div>
<br>
<p>"First you understand this is my making, entirely my making. The moment you see it you have the ability to change it. ... What is happening within you, your experince of your life is entirely your making. This is your Karma. Karma means not something that drops upon you from somewhere. Karma means your action, your making, your doing. If you just set this one thing, creating the necessary balance will happen automatically. Once there is balance, you would want to try many things." </p>
<p>&mdash; Sadhguru</p>
<br>

<h3>Precision of practices</h3>

<p>"We have to work on clarity. What is it that gives us clarity of mind? A simple thing you can do to improve clarity is to handle everything you do with a certain precision. Hatha Yoga is all about precision - how your feet should be positioned, where your hands should be, how you should hold your head, how you move, how you place the things that you brought with you and so on. If you bring precision into your activity, there will be precision in your mind. You need to practice precision in every aspect of your life. How your room should be, how you go to bed - everything. Bring the meticulousness that you apply when doing an asana, into your life. You will see, slowly, the mind will become very clear. It will become meticulous with everything."</p>
<p>&mdash; Sadhguru</p>

<br>

 <h3>Give the necessary time</h3>
 <p>The Yoga Sutra says - sukham sthiram asanam. The goal is to achieve a state where your asana is comfortable and stable; if you remain like this for any number of hours it stays the same way without causing any disturbance internally. This is when your perception becomes bigger and bigger.
  <br>The point is not about doing yoga every day or twice a week, the intention is to knead the body in such a way that we can re-mold it. So, how much time do you have, to do the necessary work upon yourself - that much time you must do it.
  </p><br>

  <h3>Make it happen</h3>
  <p>Imagine a cart with four wheels. Body, mind, emotions, and energies. If only one wheel is turning will the cart move? Usually, the mind is stuck in the mud of yesterdays or tomorrows, the memory or imagination. If the necessary mental focus is there during the practices, if at least two of the wheels are turning, others will join when they touch the ground. </p>
  <ul>
  <li>If you use your emotions and try to reach the ultimate, we call this  <b>bhakti&nbsp;yoga</b>.</li>
  <li>If you use your intelligence and try to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>gnana&nbsp;yoga</b>.</li>
  <li>If you use your body, or physical action to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>karma&nbsp;yoga</b>.</li>
  <li>If you transform your energies and try to reach the ultimate, we call this <b>kriya&nbsp;yoga</b>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="bgW2" style="margin:20px 0px"> <img src="/images/4paths-min.svg" alt="" width="90%"></div>
  <p>"These are the only four realities in your life: body, mind, emotion, and energy.
Whatever you wish to do with yourself, it must be on these four levels.
It is important that in a very balanced way all of them are addressed at once,
as&nbsp;one&nbsp;unit." &mdash; Sadhguru</p>

<h3>Seeking 24x7</h3>
<p>Seeking is an exploration of our true nature. It is to determine the nature of who we wish to be. If you want to know something the most important requirement is to pay attention. Paying attention as much as possible, without calculations and conclusions, is the essential quality that you need. Determining the nature of this human being is the most fundamental thing that is needed for anyone who wishes to grow and function at his best. If we do not know how this system functions, we will not be able to use it at its optimum, and life feels like a burden. Yoga is a technology for this seeking. Now, this need not be only during the morning or evening when we do our yogic practices. If I am really aware that ‘I do not know’ then seeking to know naturally becomes a 24x7 activity.</p>
<p>Sadhguru says, "If it is off and on, off and on, it will take lifetimes. It needs a little steady application, where it is a continuous steady rise, so that in a couple of months or a year, you should find a significant difference in the way you are. You must keep it on steadily - 24 hours. What does spirituality being "ON" mean? "Does it mean I can't go to the office? I can't be with the family?" You must make everything into a spiritual process. Talking to someone, working in the office, every single activity, every breath that you take if you make it into a spiritual process, you will see within a few months, you will be in a completely different space where your presence will be cherished in the world - not just by human beings, every other being will respond. Even animals and plants will respond to you in a wonderful way." </p>
<p>Sadhguru says, "A person on the spiritual path should be like this - you don't even have time to buy unripe bananas. You have got to be in a hurry. Once a little laxity comes, it will take lifetimes. If you are in a hurry, it is very quick. In your life, there may have been certain moments of extreme intensity and ecstatic states within you. Just imagine life like this - whatever is the peak experience that you have touched in your life, not necessarily in yoga but anywhere in your life, if you could stay there constantly every moment of your life, do you see how free you would be from the many little things which nag you and pull and push you all the time? You may not have touched the highest peak, but whatever peak you may have touched, even at that peak if you lived, you would be free from so many things that bother you on a daily basis. Nothing would really be a problem in this world." </p>
<!-- <p>Hatha Yoga enhances your ability to pay attention, it prepares your system for an enhanced perception. </p> -->
